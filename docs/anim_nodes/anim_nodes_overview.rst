.. warning:: 
    **Deprecated** 
    
    From Blender 4+, The Plating Generator's newer :ref:`Modifiers and Tools<modifiers>` have replaced many of the features used by Animation Nodes.  The Animation Nodes part of the Plating Generator is planned to be removed in a future release.  Please use the :ref:`Modifiers and Tools<modifiers>` instead.

There is also the option to use the add-on as a node in the powerful |Animation Nodes| Blender extension. This is useful if you want to either create animated effects or control the effect dynamically. 


There are two available nodes: One for generating plates and one for generating greebles separately.

The properties are similar to those of the main add-on.  

The 'Generate Plates' node looks like this:
