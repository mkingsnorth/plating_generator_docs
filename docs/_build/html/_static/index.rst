Plating Generator V2.0: You (Can) Redo
=============================================


What is the Plating Generator?

The |Plating Generator| creates customisable panel lines and |greebled| details on top of your 3D Model.  

This add-on is for 3D Modellers and concept artists who find it time consuming to create interlocking panel patterns on 3D Models such as spaceship hulls.  The most effective manual method is to extrude edge loops over and over, which can be very time consuming. The more detailed you want the mesh to be, the longer it will take:

Shape Generator is the only addon which allows users to create unique shapes and objects. It uses specially designed algorithms to generate an infinite number of new models which then become great starting points for creating new objects. There are presets for the following shape types:

Sci-Fi ships
Different futuristic weapons.
Mechs and Robots

Shape Generator combined with our Plating Generator addon can quickly create detailed models which can then be further refined. It can also be used to create libraries of curated objects which can then be used in kitbash fashion or sold by users.

The main goals of Shape Generator are:

Create an easy to use interface for creating complex shapes.
Optimize the addon for speed so users donâ€™t have to wait.
Create fantastic shapes for use as inspiration and starting points for new designs.
Provide best-in-class support and continual updates.
Create a robust product that is reliable.
Generate a solid revenue stream
