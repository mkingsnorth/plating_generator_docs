There is also the option to use the add-on as a node in the powerful |Animation Nodes| Blender extension. This is useful if you want to either create animated effects or control the effect dynamically. 


There are two available nodes: One for generating plates and one for generating greebles separately.

The :ref:`properties` are similar to those of the main add-on.  

The 'Generate Plates' node looks like this:
