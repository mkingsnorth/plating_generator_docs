* **Enabled Checkbox**: Whether the :ref:`Level<Levels>` is activated or not.
* **Plates/Greebles**: Whether we are creating Plates or Greebles.

Configure how the plating pattern is created.

* **Pattern Type**: Choose between:

    * **Generated**: Automatically generate a hull plating pattern. In Generated mode, the following options apply:
  
        * **Amount**: the amount of plate cuts generated.
  
        * **Random Seed**: generate a different selection based on the whole number given here.
  
        * **Subdivisions**: this will subdivide the selected faces before applying the plates. 

    * **Selected Edges**: Use the edges that have been already selected.
  
    * **Triangular**: Similar to Generated, with added triangular accents added randomly to the grooves. Additional properties:

        * **Triangles Random Seed**: Change where triangular parts of the grooves are added independent to the main random seed.

        * **Amount of triangles**: As a percentage, how many triangles are added to the standard pattern.
